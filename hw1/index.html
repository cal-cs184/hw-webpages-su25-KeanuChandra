		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In this code, I implemented the rasterization of triangles with interpolated colors and textures. The core idea behind rasterizing triangles lies in barycentric coordinates, which I used to determine if a point was in a triangle, where texels were located, and what colors should be displayed on the triangle. I found that the most effective anti-aliasing method to be supersampling across the board, however, there are some distinct advantages with mipmap levels and different pixel sampling techniques that can remove aliasing caused by thin and distant features. I also implemented some basic transforms in task 3, such as translation, scaling, and rotation.
		
		<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
		<p>To rasterize a triangle, I first set the bounding box of the triangle by finding the max and min x and y values among the points. I then check if these points are within the bounds of my frame. I then go through each point and calculate its barycentric coordinates. If any one of the alpha, beta, or gamma values is negative, this means the pixel is outside of the triangle and should not be filled.</p>
		<p>My algorithm checks each sample in the bounding box of the sample through a nested for loop. There are no additional iterations, so it cannot be worse than the specified algorithm.</p>

		<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
		<p>Let’s say we have a sample rate of n. This means that for every pixel in the frame buffer, we have n pixels in the sample buffer. To account for this, the sample_buffer is sized to the normal width*height but also multiplied by sample_rate. In the rasterize_triangle, additional nested for loops are added to iterate through the horizontal and vertical subpixels in a pixel and check if they are in the triangle. To resolve to framebufer the average color of all subpixels from the sample buffer for a pixel is taken. Supersampling is useful because it allows us to smooth out our final image. This removes aliasing, especially for sharp corners, by smoothing out and averaging pixels among its neighbors. This can be seen in the screenshot where the jaggies have been significantly erased through supersampling. </p>

		<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
		<p>Barycentric coordinates represent the weighting of each of the triangle's vertices. The closer a coordinate is being “pulled” to a vertex, the more its weighting for that vertex is. This can be shown in the screenshot of the triangle below. The intensity of red, green, and blue represents the alpha, beta, and gamma values. The closer it is to its corresponding vertex, the more intense the color is.</p>

		<h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
		<p>For texture mapping, the uv coordinates tell us what color should be used at a texel. We convert values to uv coordinates using barycentric interpolation. Nearest neighbor picks the closest sampled texel while bilinear sampling uses the 4 nearest texels to weight an average color. The weighting is dependent on distance, which is why I weight using the fractional distance it is away from the texel. I clamp the u and v values to ensure I do not go out of bounds of our texture map. Nearest will be sharp and jagged for corners and fine details, while bilinear will have an antialiasing effect since we are averaging colors, similarly to supersampling. </p>

		<h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
		<p>Level sampling downscales texture quality and different distances based on a mipmap level. Level 0 is the base highest quality texture map. For nearest the mipmap level was calculatied using the formula given in lecture where L equals the max of the uv distance in the x domain and the uv distance in the y domain. D, the mipmap level, then equals the log base 2 of L.I then rounded D to the nearest integer value. For linear, on the other hand, I found the two nearest mipmap levels, then averaged the two levels depending on the closeness of the value of D.</p>
		<p>These derivatives were found by calculating uv one pixel to the right for the x derivative and one pixel down for the y derivative with barycentric coords and finding the differences from the original uv values. </p>
		<p>L_ZERO is the fastest and uses the lowest memory, but results in aliasing in far distances. It is good for simple applications where antialiasing is not an issue and for close-up textures.</p>
		<p>L_NEAREST is slower and uses more memory, but allows for anti-aliasing for far away textures. The issue with nearest is that you will see exactly where the levels change since there is no smooth transition.</p>
		<p>L_LINEAR is the slowest and uses the most memory but eliminates the issue of sharp mip level transitions. It is good for applications where you want to minimize aliasing effects and hide mipmap level transitions. </p>
